# Iron Starter API Lab

## Objectives

* Complete The Iron Starter API Endpoints
* Create nested resources routes for comments
* Render reponses in JSON for created resources

## Introduction 

In this lab, we're going to finish up our Iron Starter API. In the previous lessons we built out the resources routes for Campaigns and have routes that look like 

```ruby
POST   /api/campaigns     
GET    /api/campaigns/:id
PATCH  /api/campaigns/:id
PUT    /api/campaigns/:id
DELETE /api/campaigns/:id
```

 and order
system, this time updating the product creation page to create and
display new products without requiring a refresh or redirect.

The solution for the previous lab has been included for you.
